# Background Processing
The challenge requires you to resume a suspended a process in the background rather than the foreground.

## My Solve
**Flag:**  'pwn.college{wEsxT0QcDrHdDDwzpJyGJL7CVVw.QX3QDO0wSM0AzNzEzW}'

I executed just the '/challenge/run' command followed by using ctrl+Z to suspend the process, and then I resumed the process by using the 'bg' command which enables the process to run in the background, and then relaunched a copy of the run process.

## What I learned
I learned that we can also resume suspended processes to the background rather than the foreground. This gives us our terminal space back, while keeping the process running.
I also learned that we can see the status of process using the 'ps' command with an '-o' option, where 'T' means suspended, 'S' means that the bash is sleeping while waiting for input, and 'R' means running, with the '+' operator meaning it is running in the foreground
