# Killing Processes
The challenge requires you to kill a process.

## My Solve
**Flag:**  'pwn.college{89WrBugd_CZdALKkBfAk2iLFHaM.QXyQDO0wSM0AzNzEzW}'

I executed just the 'ps -e' command first but that didn't give us the information we needed; so, I ran the 'ps -ef' command, which gave us the PID for the 'dont_run' process, which is essential to kill it and obtain out flag.
Next, I used the 'kill 136' command after getting to know that the PID is 136.
Finally, we can do '/challenge/run' to get our flag.

## What I learned
I learned how to kill a process by using the 'kill' command with the PID as the argument. 
Killing processes can prove to be just as essential as launching and listing them, since a lot of the time we'll have junk process cloggin up our system resources, or we may simply not need them anymore and wish to dispose them off. As such, killing processes is very useful.
