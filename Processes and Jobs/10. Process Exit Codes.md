# Process Exit Codes
The challenge teaches us to get the error code when a process is exiting.

## My Solve
**Flag:**  'pwn.college{0xJBaaokGlVA7qi-BucBUt50n_e.QX5YDO1wSM0AzNzEzW}'

I executed just the '/challenge/get-code' command, followed by 'echo $?' which gives us the error code we need and then we can run the '/challenge/submit-code' command to get our flag.
