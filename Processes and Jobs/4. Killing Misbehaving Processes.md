# Killing Misbehaving Processes
This challenge requires you to kill a process that is causing problems by creating decoy flags.

## My Solve
**Flag:** 'pwn.college{M_OMOrc4n7CjdUDuPKpSThpgfH9.0FNzMDOxwSM0AzNzEzW}'

First, I executed the 'ps aux' command to get the PID for the process to be killed, we find that to be 142.
Next, we kill that process and then use '/challenge/run' to pipe our flag to a fifo, but this takes up our terminal, so we are forced to pause the process using ctrl+z.
Then, we use 'bg' to transfer the process to the background and then do 'cat /tmp/flag_fifo' to read our fifo, which gives us the list of the decoys+the real flag.
We can decipher that the real flag must be the last since first, the decoy process was running and filling the fifo with fake flags, but later we stopped it and piped the real flag into it, which means it has to be the last in the long list of flags.

## What I learned
I learned the importance of killing misbehaving processes and why it is useful. 
I also learned how to apply a rather unconventional approach to solve problems sometimes when there seems to be no better alternative, or at least any that I can think of.
