# Starting Background Processing
The challenge teaches us how to background a process without suspending it.

## My Solve
**Flag:**  'pwn.college{MOZguW0ueOl3SjkhmnALRN6cHAO.QX5QDO0wSM0AzNzEzW}'

I executed just the '/challenge/run &' command. Here the '&' signals to the shell that we want this process to run in the background.

## What I learned
I learned how to save time by pushing processes to the background right off the bat without suspending and resuming them first. 
This can be done using the '&' operator which signals to the shell that we want the process to run in the background.

## References
Nil.
