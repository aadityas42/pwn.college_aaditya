The challenge requires you to resume a suspended a process.

I executed just the '/challenge/run' command followed by using ctrl+Z to suspend the process, and then I resumed the process by using the 'fg' command which brings the process back to the foreground from the background.

## What I learned
I learned that we can also resume suspended processes, because if not, we might as well have interrupted them. 
The only good reason to suspend a process rather than interrupt it, is if we wish to bring it back to the foreground of the terminal by resuming it since it will be of use later but is clogging space up for now.
