# Suspending Processes
The challenge requires you to suspend a process.

## My Solve
**Flag:**  'pwn.college{U6Jx9XBhYSYA_lLDEA0KNgSbdrN.QX1QDO0wSM0AzNzEzW}'

I executed just the '/challenge/run' command followed by using ctrl+Z to suspend the process, and then again launch the run process to get our flag.

## What I learned
I learned that sometimes, there is a less drastic way of stopping a process. Rather than interrupting it using the ctrl+c command we can instead temporarily suspend a process to the background using the ctrl+z command, this also enables us to resume the process at any point in the future when we need it again.

## References
