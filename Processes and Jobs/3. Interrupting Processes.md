# Interrupting Processes
The challenge requires you to interrupt a process.

## My Solve
**Flag:**  'pwn.college{kwfNjPYFkadcQNXlf1PNH8OXgHc.QXzQDO0wSM0AzNzEzW}'

I executed just the '/challenge/run' command followed by using ctrl+C to interrupt the process and then get our flag.

## What I learned
I learned how to interrupt a process that is not needed or is just clogging up our terminal using the ctrl+C hotkey. This sends an interrupt to whichever command is waiting for an input from the terminal, and causes them to exit cleanly.

## References
Nil.
