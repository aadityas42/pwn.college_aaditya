# Foreground Processing
The challenge requires you to bring a process from the background to the foreground.

## My Solve
**Flag:**  'pwn.college{83FqC6-Bl3PVKjim3vc5b7ergig.QX4QDO0wSM0AzNzEzW}'

I executed just the '/challenge/run' command followed by using ctrl+Z to suspend the process, and then I resumed the process by using the 'bg' command which resumes the process in the background, follow by the 'fg' command to bring this process to the foreground.

## What I learned
I learned that we can bring already resumed processes from the background to the foreground using the 'fg' command after resuming the process to the background using 'bg'.

## References
Nil.
