# Other users with su
The challenge requires you to switch users using the su command.

## My Solve
**Flag:**  'pwn.college{wSsQQU-adw5TeLrdDqxF7J5LcDv.QX2UDN1wSM0AzNzEzW}'

I executed the 'su zardus' command to switch user to zardus, and then entered the password 'dont-hack-me' and then did '/challenge/run' to get the flag.

## What I learned
I learned that when we use the 'su' command with an argument, say the name of some user, the system will siwtch our current user to the one we entered rather than the default that is root.

## References
Nil.
