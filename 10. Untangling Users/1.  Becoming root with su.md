# Becoming root with su
The challenge requires you to become the root of the system using the su command.

## My Solve
**Flag:**  'pwn.college{wylXg5i7z58TYrNz3TtxiZ2GIVU.QX1UDN1wSM0AzNzEzW}'

First, I executed the 'su' command and entered the give password 'hack-the-planet' to become root, then looking around for a bit gives us the flag.

## What I learned
I learned that the system administrator also called as the root is one of the most important users, who has deeper access to a lot of utilities. 
I learned we can use the 'su' (substitute user) command along with a password to become the root, though most modern sysstems don't have passwords for authentication, they use other methods, since 'su' is an older format.

## References
Nil.
