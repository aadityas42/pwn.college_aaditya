# Using Sudo
This challenge requires you to use the sudo command to get privilaged access.

## My Solve
**Flag:**'pwn.college{UqDJ-wttu7Nof_vIQuexpEtJRMi.QX4UDN1wSM0AzNzEzW}'

I simply executed the 'sudo cat /flag' command to directly view the flag using our elevated privilages.

```
hacker@users~using-sudo:~$ sudo cat /flag
pwn.college{UqDJ-wttu7Nof_vIQuexpEtJRMi.QX4UDN1wSM0AzNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
I learned that the world has moved on from the 'su' command to the 'sudo' command since it is a hassle to keep track of passwords.
Sudo originally stood for superuse do, but now has the meaning 'substitute user,do' and don't work very well to larger environments
WHile su checks for a password, sudo checks for policies to determine whether or not to give access to root, and these policies are stored in '/etc/sudoers'.
