# The PATH Variable
The challenge requires you to disable the rm command using the PATH variable.

## My Solve
**Flag:**  `pwn.college{oy2NSZSQMYIDgmO9-saKPCzk9MS.QX2cDM1wSM0AzNzEzW}`

First, I ran the `PATH=""` command which empties the path variable which also contains the `rm` command, which was going to be used to destroy the flag.

Now, that we remove it. The flag can't be destroyed, and we obtain it using `/challenge/run`

## What I learned
I learned that the PATH variable stores the directory paths to a lot of the commands we commonly use in linux.
Without the PATH variabel, commands like `ls` and `rm` won't function as their paths will be missing.

## References
Nil.
