# Finding Commands
The challenge requires you to obtain the path of a command.

## My Solve
**Flag:**  `pwn.college{AZ8SjuUKvdfJJA71uHcFcCY-tRh.01NzEzNxwSM0AzNzEzW}`

I ran the `which win` command to get the directory in which the win command is located.
Then, I ran `cat /challenge/paths/13067/flag` command since flag is located in the same directory as `win`

## What I learned
I learned that we can obtain the path to the directory in which any command is located using the `which` command. This enables us to perform a wide range of fuctions.
`which` looks at each directory in the $PATH in order and prints the first file it finds with the same name as the one we gave in the argument.

## References
Nil.
