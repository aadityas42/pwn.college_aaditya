# Setting PATH
The challenge requires you to add a path to the PATH variable.

## My Solve
**Flag:**  `pwn.college{sso1McyKYES-9nnNurGjvK8WY7v.QX1cjM1wSM0AzNzEzW}`

First, I ran the `PATH=/challenge/more_commands/` command to add the `win` command to the PATH variable by adding it's path in it.

## What I learned
I learned that the PATH variable can also be used to do useful things by adding other paths to it rather than just removing paths from it.

Like in this challenge, we added the path of the `win` command to the PATH variable which enabled us to run it directly using `/challenge/run`

## References
Nil.
