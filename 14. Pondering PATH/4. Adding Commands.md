# Adding Commands
The challenge requires you to add a command of your own to the PATH variable.

## My Solve
**Flag:**  `pwn.college{QOB6X24HQp1BUP6qQeLbc7muPqS.QX2cjM1wSM0AzNzEzW}`

First, I created a temporary folder abc `/tmp/abc` to serve as our printing directory and cd'ed to it.

I had also previously ran `which cat` which gave me the directory in which cat is located, so our next command is:

`echo '/run/dojo/bin/cat /flag' > win` to store our path for flag execution in the 'win' script.

Next, we make 'win' an executable by using `chmod +x win`

Finally, we use `PATH=$(pwd) /challenge/run` which stores it in the PATH variable as a command and gets executed, giving us our flag.

## What I learned
There was a lot to learn from this challenge. 

It helped recap a lot of concepts, from making a temporary directory, thw `which` command, creating scripts, changing permissions using `chmod` and storing programs in the `PATH` variable.

This challenge took me a while to get correctly and I had to use an external reference to understand the $(pwd) in place of writing the `/tmp/abc` as our printing directory despite it being our cwd.
