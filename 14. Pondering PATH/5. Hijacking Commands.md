# Hijacking Commands
The challenge requires you to make a command that hijacks another.

## My Solve
**Flag:**  `pwn.college{wP_FIuA8Xuix2kE-QFCn6B8FnHy.QX3cjM1wSM0AzNzEzW}`

First, I created a temporary folder abc `/tmp/abc` to serve as our printing directory and cd'ed to it.

I had also previously ran `which cat` which gave me the directory in which cat is located, so our next command is:

`echo '/run/dojo/bin/cat /flag' > rm` to store our path for flag execution in the 'rm' script. This essentially hijacks it by rdisabling it's ability to remove a file and replacing it with the `cat` command.

Next, we make 'rm' an executable by using `chmod +x win`

Finally, we use `PATH=$(pwd) /challenge/run` which stores it in the PATH variable as a command and gets executed, giving us our flag.

## What I learned
I learned that we can also "hijack" another command using the PATH variable. That is, we can replace it's function with another function, rather than just emptying it or making a new function elsewhere.
We can do both these things together by "hijacking".
