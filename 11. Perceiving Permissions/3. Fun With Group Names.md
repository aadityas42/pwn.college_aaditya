# Fun with group names
The challenge requires you to change the user to get the flag.

## My Solve
**Flag:**  'pwn.college{soxOKNlQhRNn5-HEZhEsMJVComR.QXxcjM1wSM0AzNzEzW}'

I executed the 'chgrp grp 5233 /flag' command to change the ownership of the group that the flag but, this time we use the username 'grp5233' rather than 'hacker' since sometimes, all users are put under one common group called 'users' so, we learned how to access the flag from some other user.

## What I learned
I learned that while there is a convention in linux that every user has their own group, but this does not have to be the case. In some cases, all users are clubbed together in a single group, generally known as 'users'.
I learned how to access the flag by using another user rather than hacker.
I also learned how to use the id command to check what groups we are currently a part of.
