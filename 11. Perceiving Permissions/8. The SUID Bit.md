# The SUID Bit
The challenge requires you to setup a SUID bit to get the flag.

## My Solve
**Flag:**  `pwn.college{oj3A1kBpBJsHrHt8xE7OgoyEUid.QXzEjN0wSM0AzNzEzW}`

I executed the `chmod u+s /challenge/getroot` command to setup a SUID bit in place of an execute bit in the getroot file, then ran the program and catted the flag.

I tried catting the flag directly first, but then realised that I have to execute the file first.

## What I learned
I learned that we can use an 's' or SUID(Set User ID) bit in place of executable parameter in the permissions of a file, this essentially allows any user with this bit to execute files owned by the root/owner user.
I also learned that giving users a SUID for a file owned by the root can provide a possible attack vector for users with malicious intent to become root.
