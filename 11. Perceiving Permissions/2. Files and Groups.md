# Files and Groups
The challenge requires you to change the ownership of a group.

## My Solve
**Flag:**  'pwn.college{soxOKNlQhRNn5-HEZhEsMJVComR.QXxcjM1wSM0AzNzEzW}'

I executed the 'chgrp hacker /flag' command to change the ownership of the group that the flag is contained in so that we can access it directly using the 'cat /flag' command as the 'hacker' user.

```
hacker@permissions~groups-and-files:~$ chgrp hacker /flag
hacker@permissions~groups-and-files:~$ cat /flag
pwn.college{soxOKNlQhRNn5-HEZhEsMJVComR.QXxcjM1wSM0AzNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
I learned that groups, much like files, also have an ownership system along with something called a group.
A group can ahve multiple users in it and one member can be a part of multiple groups at the same time.
This command also generally requires us to have root access, unless we have write access to the file and membership in the group since it can be missused if everyone has access to it freely.
A typical linux system will have a lot of groups on it
