# Executable Files
The challenge requires you to change the permissions of a file to access it.

## My Solve
**Flag:**  'pwn.college{g0KWVipUdJWhh1XQWHTeFgGqfem.QXyEjN0wSM0AzNzEzW}'

I executed the 'chmod +x /challenge/run' command to change the permissions of the '/challenge/run' file so that other users who are not a part of the group that own it, or are not the root can also execute the run file.

## What I learned
This challenge was more about applying what I learned about changing permissions in the last challenge, rather than learning new knowledge.
Here we change the execution part rather than the reading part.

## References
Nil.
