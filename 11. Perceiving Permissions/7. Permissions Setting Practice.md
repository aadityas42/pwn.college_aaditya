# Permission Setting practice
The challenge requires you to set permission for the /challenge/pwn file 8 times and then once for flag.

## My Solve
**Flag:**  `pwn.college{YE9izCFzm0-Zt4jHDBNGQI067HC.QXzETO0wSM0AzNzEzW}`

This solve was pretty much identical to the last one, using `u=,g=,o=` to set permissions for a given file.
