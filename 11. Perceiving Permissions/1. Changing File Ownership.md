# Changing File Ownership
The challenge requires you to change the ownership privilages so that we can access the flag directly.

## My Solve
**Flag:**  'pwn.college{oL6R6GuHNhxiYkNvZiA9NLkzfLH.QXxEjN0wSM0AzNzEzW}'

I executed the 'chown hacker /flag' command by using our root access to change ownership of the '/flag' file to the 'hacker' user, that is us, which enables us to directly use the 'cat /flag' command to read the flag.

## What I learned
I learned that every single file is 'owned' by some user in linux. This becomes significant when there are multiple users on the same system, say in a workspace or a lab.
We can change the owndership of these files in linux using the 'chown' or change owner command. This can gnereally be done only by the root user.
The 'chown' command is extremely powerful as it can give us direct access to files without having to use other commands or find any exploits/gaps in the security of a system.
