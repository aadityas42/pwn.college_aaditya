# Changing Permissions
The challenge requires you to change the permissions of a file to access it.

## My Solve
**Flag:**  'pwn.college{sTq3Xbln4GGHCj4svKktfIpkpwX.QXzcjM1wSM0AzNzEzW}'

I executed the 'chmod o+rx /flag' command to change the permissions of the '/flag' file so that other users who are not a part of the group that own the flag, or are not the root can also read and execute the flag file.

## What I learned
I learned that we can change the permissions of a file with respect to it's read, write, and execute permissions.
there are 3 parts in the permission specifications of a file- first is for the user who owns the file, second for the other users in the group that owns the files, and lastly for all other users.
These are represented by u,g, and a respectively.
These are furthur combined with 3 more permissions, namely- read(r), write(w), and execute(x). If a file doesn't give a particular permission for some user, it is represented by '-' in place of the respective letter specifying the type of permission.
The 'a' argument stands for all, and an argument like'a-rwx' removes the read, write and execute permissions for all users.
