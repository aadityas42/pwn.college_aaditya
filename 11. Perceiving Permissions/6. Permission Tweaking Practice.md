# Permission Tweaking practice
The challenge requires you to reset permission for the /challenge/pwn file 8 times and then once for flag.

## My Solve
**Flag:**  'pwn.college{EJSHr5Gj3Ztd_xKY0l6cr-QaYdc.QXwEjN0wSM0AzNzEzW}'

There is not much to elaborate on in this, I simply used the appropriate permissions as mentioned in the instructions to proceed forward with the 8 rounds, after that, I just enabled all permissions for the flag and then ran the flag file.
I did mess up multiple times, once for writing '/challenge/run' instead of /challenge/pwn because of a matter of habbit.

## What I learned
This challenge is more about applying everything I learned about 'chmodding' so far in a long and strenuous challenge, but it was somewhat frustrating because of making some small mistakes here and there.

## References
