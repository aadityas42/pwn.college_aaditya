# Understanding Shebangs
The challenge requires you to make a script executable so that you can rush it without the bash command.

## My Solve
**Flag:**  `pwn.college{Ent2nJx47is_-GtOGkVYctbEnos.0VOzMDOxwSM0AzNzEzW}`

First, I created the script by `nano /home/hacker/solve.sh`

I included a proper shebang `#!/bin/bash` as the first line and included `echo "hack the planet"` inside, as mentioned in the challenge description.

Next, I made the script executable using `chmod +x /home/hacker/solve.sh`

Finally, `/challenge/run` checks our script and gives us the flag

## What I learned
I learned how to put a shebang in a script so that linux treats the file as an interpreted program.
I learned that this is the reason we enter a `#!` at the start of a script.

## References
Nil.
