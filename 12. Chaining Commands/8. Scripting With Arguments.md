# Scripting With Arguments
The challenge requires you to make a script that takes two inputs and prints them in reverse order.

## My Solve
**Flag:**  `pwn.college{AdipCog9kuLwF72VaL0hbM5Wf0X.0VNzMDOxwSM0AzNzEzW}`

First, I used the `nano` command to write the script with the following contents:

```
#!/bin/bash

echo $2 $1
```
then, I ran `/challenge/run` and got the flag.

It taught me how to implement scripts for making simple commands of my own.
