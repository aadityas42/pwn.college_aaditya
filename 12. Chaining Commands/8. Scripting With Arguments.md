# Scripting With Arguments
The challenge requires you to make a script that takes two inputs and prints them in reverse order.

## My Solve
**Flag:**  `pwn.college{gh0hD4VW_JkyChJUfFNhyHCQaWS.0lMwgDOxwSM0AzNzEzW}`

First, I used the `nano` command to write the script with the following contents:

```
#!/bin/bash

echo $2
echo $1
```
then, I ran `/challenge/run` used cat on it to figure out the correct guess, and go the flag.

## What I learned
I learned how to use the `nano` command to write a script and also how to save a script using it.

It taught me how to implement scripts for making simple commands of my own.
