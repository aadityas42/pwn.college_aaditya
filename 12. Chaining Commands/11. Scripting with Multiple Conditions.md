# Scripting with Multiple Conditions
The challenge requires you to make a script using the conditional operator `if` while providing a default case.

## My Solve
**Flag:**  `pwn.college{ELla2y94LShbyywBOOspdeh5MMT.0FOzMDOxwSM0AzNzEzW}`

First, I created the script by `nano /home/hacker/solve.sh`. 

Then I entered the appropriate `if` statement into the script, abiding by the conditions mentioned in the challenge.

This time, I also added multiple `elif` statements along with a default for unwanted incputs, since there are multiple case specific conditions.

Finally, `/challenge/run` gives us the flag.
