# Redirecting Script Output
The challenge requires you to store two commands in a script and then pipe the ouput of the script to another command.

## My Solve
**Flag:**  `pwn.college{IsbJ5o9gDQLFiT2a_5TQYkR4TDY.QX4ETO0wSM0AzNzEzW}`

First I executed the `echo "/challenge/pwn" > script.sh; echo "/challenge/college" >> script.sh` command, to store the two commands in the script.
Then I used `bash script.sh | /challenge/solve` to pipe the output of our script into the `/challenge/solve` as the challenge description has asked.

## What I learned
I learned that we can redirect the output of our script too, using operators like | , >, >>, 2>.
This is useful to redirect the outputs of several programs into a single program.

## References
Nil.
