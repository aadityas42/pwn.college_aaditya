# Scripting with Default Case
The challenge requires you to make a script using the conditional operator `if` while providing a default case.

## My Solve
**Flag:**  `pwn.college{UaNzBgbfKtHwm-h8JbtzChYPbZF.01NzMDOxwSM0AzNzEzW}`

First, I created the script by `nano /home/hacker/solve.sh`. 

Then I entered the appropriate `if` statement into the script, abiding by the conditions mentioned in the challenge.

This time, I also added a default case using `else` to print 'nope' in case the input isn't what the script expects.

Finally, `/challenge/run` gives us the flag.
