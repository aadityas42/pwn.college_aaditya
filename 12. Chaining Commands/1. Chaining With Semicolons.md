# Chaining With Semicolons
The challenge requires you to chain two commands using a semicolon.

## My Solve
**Flag:**  `pwn.college{UVkLKOeor_Duf6byXyN68q7mxfT.QX1UDO0wSM0AzNzEzW}`

For this challenge, we simply need to execute the `/challenge/pwn; /challenge/college` command, which chains the two seperate commands via a semicolon.

## What I learned
I learned that we can chain commands via the use of a semicolon. That is, use two commands in a single line in the terminal by seperating them using a semicolon `;` 
This is similar to a programming language like C or C++ where we need to include a semicolon at the end of each statement to indicate that it is terminated there and a new command follows the semicolon.
This can be useful when we want to carry out multiple operations in a single command line to get all of the outputs simultaneously.

Nil.
