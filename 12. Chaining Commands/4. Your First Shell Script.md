# Your First Shell Script
The challenge requires you to run programs inside our first shell script.

## My Solve
**Flag:**  `pwn.college{kDnUDntnN0I1KKmMefG5n5hUiby.QXxcDO0wSM0AzNzEzW}`

First I tried executing the `echo "/challenge/pwn > x.sh` and `echo "/challenge/college" > x.sh` commands, which gave an error. I realised that this is because in the second command, I had to use `>>` instead of `>` since the latter rewrites the contents rather than adding to them.

On making the appropriate correction and rerunning the commands and then the script file by `bash x.sh` we get the flag.

## What I learned
Sometimes when we use a lot of commands with piping and chaining, the commands can get really long. As such, it is generally preferred to store them in a shell script (generally named using an 'sh' in the name)and run them through it.

I also learned how exactly do we redirect commands to this script and how to execute them.

It was also a good recap of the rediretion operators in which I made an error initially.

## References
Nil.
