# Scripting with Conditionals
The challenge requires you to make a script using the conditional operator `if` instead of arguments.

## My Solve
**Flag:**  `pwn.college{AVjUfIMgaH1lfve9EcWOR8cD7jv.0lNzMDOxwSM0AzNzEzW}`

First, I created the script by `nano /home/hacker/solve.sh`. 

Then I entered the appropriate `if` statement into the script, abiding by the conditions mentioned in the challenge.

Finally, `/challenge/run` gives us the flag.
