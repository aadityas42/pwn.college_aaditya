# Building on Success
The challenge requires you to chain two commands using the `&&` operator.

## My Solve
**Flag:**  `pwn.college{YudQunlxd3PHkqeOOozrHjA6i49.0lM0MDOxwSM0AzNzEzW}`

For this challenge, we simply need to execute the `/challenge/first-success /challenge/second` command, which chains the two commands on the condition that if command 1 executes successfully, command 2 will be executed.
First, I entered the two commands seperately to see what error I get for that, as suggested in the challenge description.

## What I learned
I learned that we can chain commands using the `&&` (AND) operator which executes the second command on the condition that the first command is executed successfully.
This yields the correct result only when both commands are executed successfully. As such, it proves to be useful when we are subjected to complex workflows where one command depends on the success of another.
