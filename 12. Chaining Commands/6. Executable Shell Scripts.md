# Executable Shell Scripts
The challenge requires you to make a script executable so that you can rush it without the bash command.

## My Solve
**Flag:**  `pwn.college{ASnWDfj5px-NAICsvtGUbT3IzQA.QX0cjM1wSM0AzNzEzW}`

First, I created the script by `echo "/challenge/solve" > script.sh` 

Next, I made it executable by changing it's file permissions using `chmod u=wrx,g=wrx,o=wrx /home/hacker/script.sh`

Finally, executing the script directly using `/home/hacker/script.sh` gives us the flag.

## What I learned
I learned how to run a script without using the `bash` command, and that if we make it executable by changing it's file permissions using the `chmod` command, we can run it directly using it's absolute or relative path, without having the need to invoke the `bash` command.
