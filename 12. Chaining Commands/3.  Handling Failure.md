# Handling Failure
The challenge requires you to chain two commands using the `||` operator.

**Flag:**  `pwn.college{o2THtw2kINThfDJlh9dqJUX0jTB.01M0MDOxwSM0AzNzEzW}`

For this challenge, we simply need to execute the `/challenge/first-failure || challenge/second` command, which chains the two commands on the condition that if command 1 fails to exeute, command 2 will be executed.

## What I learned
I learned that we can also use the `||` (OR) operator to chain commands. This works in the way opposite to that of the 'AND' operator, that is, if the first command fails execution, only then will the second command be executed.
This command can prove to be especially useful while error handling since the condition makes it easy to catch errors that cause failure of execution of programs.
