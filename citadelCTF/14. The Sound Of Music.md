## Description

ðŸ—¼OSINT pt2: `citadweller` had a newfound interest in tracking the music they *last* listened to and posting ratings of new albums on various online platforms.

The flag is hidden in these digital footprints across music platforms and split into three segments. You will need to find all three to uncover the complete code and move on to the next floor.

## Flag: `citadel{c0mputers_st0pped_exchang1ng_1nf0rmat10n_n_started_shar1ng_st0r1es_n_then_they_were_n0where_t0_be_f0und}`

## Solve

The challenge description says that there should be hints on various music platforms under the name of `citadweller`.

So, to find these profiles, I used google dorking, which gave me the link to the rateyourmusic profile for citadweller.

In their description, we are given part II of the flag, along with a tinyurl link which leads us to a public spotify playlist named `OSINT pt2` which gives us part III of the flag. [_n_started_shar1ng_st0r1es] and [_n_then_they_were_n0where_t0_be_f0und}]

The first part of the flag can be found on the last.fm profile named `citadweller`  under the shoutbox section. [citadel{c0mputers_st0pped_exchang1ng_1nf0rmat10n ]

We can combine all of these three parts to get our final flag that is: `citadel{c0mputers_st0pped_exchang1ng_1nf0rmat10n_n_started_shar1ng_st0r1es_n_then_they_were_n0where_t0_be_f0und}`
