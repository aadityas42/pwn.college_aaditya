## My Solve

First, I tried a bunch of random commands to check how the system is operating(like cat and ls)
Some commands were not working, and others, like `sudo` gave a suspicious command type error.
The, I discovered that `%0A` enables us to chain commands properly.
I used the `ls` command to list the files in the directory to see if any of them are of interest to us.
There, I located a file called `mission_briefing.txt`  which tells us that the file is located deep inside some directories and files.
So, we go to the aethercorp directory using `cd` and then use `ls` to list all of iot's files.
Going deeper into the corp, we discover a folder named `.secrets` from which we get the `blacksite_key.dat` file.
On reading the contents of the file, we obtain the flag.
