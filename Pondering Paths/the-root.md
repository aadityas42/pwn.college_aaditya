# The Root
The challenge requires you to use the '/' command to invoke a program called pwn

## My Solve
**Flag:**  'pwn.college{8Vi4SznEGuih26TgbuqET-JkRYb.QX4cTO0wSM0AzNzEzW}'

As specified, all that is to be done is to enter '/pwn' into the terminal to invoke the pwn program.

```
hacker@paths~the-root:~$ /pwn
BOOM!!!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{8Vi4SznEGuih26TgbuqET-JkRYb.QX4cTO0wSM0AzNzEzW}

```

## What I learned
I learned that the '/' command encapsulates directories, configuration files, and flags, and can be used to invoke a program, and the style of invoking it from the root directory is called as an absolute path.

## References
Nil.
