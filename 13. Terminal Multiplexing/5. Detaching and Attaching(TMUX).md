# Detaching and Attaching(TMUX)
The challenge requires you to navigate through multiple windows in a screen.

## My Solve

**Flag:**  `pwn.college{ElnmzP0wNjLhBl1w4P54ahjfe_w.0VO4IDOxwSM0AzNzEzW}`

I ran the `tmux` command to attach to a screen, used ctrl-B followed by D to detach, ran `/challenge/run` and then reattached to the window by using `tmux a`

## What I learned
I learned that TMUX, or terminal multiplexer is a younger version of the screen command, this follows a slightly different convention, like using ctrl-B instead of ctrl-A before entering any argument for a command to navigate around the screen.
All instances of screen are replace by `tmux` and we use `-a` or `attach` instead of `-r` to reattach to a program.
