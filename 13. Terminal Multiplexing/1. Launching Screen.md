# Launching Screen
The challenge requires you to create a virtual terminal inside of our terminal.

## My Solve
**Flag:**  `pwn.college{U1yeik57r3wmIqdNsTOferIWuZa.0VN4IDOxwSM0AzNzEzW}`

I simply ran the `screen` command which creates a virtual terminal inside our main one and gives us the flag for this challenge.

## What I learned
I learned that we can create virtual terminals inside of our main terminal using the `screen` command, much like opoening multipl tabs in a browser.
Typing exit or ctrl+D will bring us back to our main terminal.

## References
Nil.
