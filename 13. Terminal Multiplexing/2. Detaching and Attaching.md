# Detaching and Attaching
The challenge requires you to create a virtual terminal inside then detach and reattach to it.

I simply ran the `screen` command which creates a virtual terminal, then used ctrl+a then D to detach from it, then I ran `/challenge/run`.
Finally, to reattach, i used the `screen -r 147` command, where 147 was the id for the screen we had to reattach to.

## What I learned
I learned that we can reattach to a terminal that we have detached from, without losing out on any work if an important program was running.
This is useful in cases where we might lose connection to the terminal or even if we want to detach from the terminal on purpose for some other purposes.
