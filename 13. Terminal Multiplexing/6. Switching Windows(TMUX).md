# Switching Windows(TMUX)
The challenge requires you to navigate through multiple windows in a screen using TMUX.

## My Solve

**Flag:**  `pwn.college{wseesK1964qL_YEfdUbNbDWmRwJ.0FM5IDOxwSM0AzNzEzW}`

I ran the `tmux` command to attach to a screen, used ctrl-B followed by 0 to get the flag.

*Note: I couldn't attach a screenshot here since the output in the tmux screen was in scrollable format, so there was no way to attach it in form of a screenshot.*


## What I learned
I learned how to apply naviagtion commands in tmux format.

While the commands remain almost identical, all we need to do is replace ctrl-A with ctrl-B and use all the other naviagtion commands as usual to get around our windows in TMUX.

## References
Nil.
