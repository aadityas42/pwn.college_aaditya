I simply ran the `screen -ls` comand to get a list of all detached screens, and then reattached suing `screen -r 137` and then navigated through the windows using ctrl-A 0,1 for the two windows respectively.

## What I learned
I learned that we have multiple windows inside of a single screen, like multiple tabs while browsing.

We can navigate through these windows by using ctr-A followed by numbers 0-9 depending on which window we want to switch to.

I also learned that c is for creating a new window, n and p are for next and previous windows respectively and " brings up a selection of all available windows. All of these have the predecessor ctrl-A.

## References
