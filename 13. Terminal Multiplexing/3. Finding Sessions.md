# Finding Sessions
The challenge requires you to create a virtual terminal inside then detach and reattach to it.

## My Solve
**Flag:**  `pwn.college{0q_kSXxhZL2QqaB-V3f1rrXWDZc.01N4IDOxwSM0AzNzEzW}`

I simply ran the `screen -ls` comand to get a list of all detached screens, and went through them, finding the flag in the 2nd one with PID 147.

## What I learned
I learned that we can reattach to a specific terminal from a list of given terminals by using the name or PID of that screen.
These can be found out using the `screen -ls` command.

## References
Nil.
