# Making Directories
The challenge requires you to create a directory and a file within it.

## My Solve
**Flag:**  'pwn.college{ItsuLA9Hn8uy8tIvSU0NZ2R6826.QXxMDO0wSM0AzNzEzW}'

First we execute the 'mkdir /tmp/pwn' command to create a directory 'pwn in the tmp directory, then we use 'touch college' to make a file named college.

```
hacker@commands~making-directories:~$ mkdir /tmp/pwn
hacker@commands~making-directories:~$ cd /tmp/pwn
hacker@commands~making-directories:/tmp/pwn$ touch college
hacker@commands~making-directories:/tmp/pwn$ /challenge/run
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{ItsuLA9Hn8uy8tIvSU0NZ2R6826.QXxMDO0wSM0AzNzEzW}

```
