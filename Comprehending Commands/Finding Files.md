# Finding FIles
The challenge requires you to use 'find' command to find the flag, amongst multiple files with the name flag.

## My Solve
Technically Difficulties/Errors preventing from obtaining flag despite correct inputs/commands.

## What I learned
I learned how to use the 'find' command to find one or multiple files with that name amongst a large number of files.
I also learned how to use the command with the '-name' argument which specifially searches for the files based on their name.
Multiple other arguments can be used along with the find command though here we focus on '-name'

## References
Nil.
