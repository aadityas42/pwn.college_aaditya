# Setting Variables
The challenge requires you to use the assignment operator '=' to assign a value to a variable.

## My Solve
**Flag:**  'pwn.college{Yvh7XY6bLmuvNxR0hTQT6-wfbDN.QX5UTN0wSM0AzNzEzW}'

We simply need to use the 'PWN=COLLEGE' command to assign the value 'COLLEGE' to the variable 'PWN'.

```
hacker@variables~setting-variables:~$ PWN=COLLEGE
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{Yvh7XY6bLmuvNxR0hTQT6-wfbDN.QX5UTN0wSM0AzNzEzW}
```
