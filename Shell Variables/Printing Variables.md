# Printing Variables
The challenge requires you to use the '$' operand to print the FLAG variable.

## My Solve
**Flag:**  'pwn.college{QsLaKo_fzXrmtRROaXM2oI4sWgQ.QX3UTN0wSM0AzNzEzW}'

We simply need to use the 'echo $FLAG' command for this challenge, the '$' operator specifies that FLAG is a variable.

```
hacker@variables~printing-variables:~$ echo $FLAG
pwn.college{QsLaKo_fzXrmtRROaXM2oI4sWgQ.QX3UTN0wSM0AzNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
I that the flag was stored in a variable all along, I also learned how to print variables.

## References
Nil.
