# Extracting the First Lines with Head
The challenge requires you to grab just the first few lines out of a bunch of data

## My Solve
**Flag:**  'pwn.college{cOJZrk8f403rNMLm1s7Ri3Frb65.0lNxEzNxwSM0AzNzEzW}'

In this challenge, we use the 'head -n 7' command to get the first 7 lines from the piped data of 'pwn' and then pipe that into 'college'.

```
hacker@data~extracting-the-first-lines-with-head:~$ /challenge/pwn | head -n 7 | /challenge/college
Congratulations, you piped the right codes!
pwn.college{cOJZrk8f403rNMLm1s7Ri3Frb65.0lNxEzNxwSM0AzNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
I learned how to get just the first few lines from any given file using the 'head' command, and that we can specify the number of lines we wish to extract using the '-n no_of_lines' argument along with it.
Sometimes, we might need to grab just the starting few lines since often, they contain all the data we need. So, I learned a more efficent approach of obtaining this data rather than having to get the entire data, most of which will be redudant.

## References
