# Sorting Data
The challenge requires you to sort a list of 101 flags to obtain the real one amongst 100 fakes.

## My Solve
**Flag:**  'pwn.college{AZqFtGZbLUF-nc7f0J6fIWdvVwP.0FM0MDOxwSM0AzNzEzW}'

In this challenge, we use the 'sort -r /challenge/flags.txt' command to sort the list of 101 flags in reverse order, since we are told that the real flag appears at the end when sorted normally. This means that when sorted in reverse, the real flag will be the first in the list.

## What I learned
I learned how to sort a list of data in normal, reverse, numeric orders and also how to eliminate duplicates and print a randomised list using the 'sort' command.
Sorting a list of given elements is a crucial tool to have, which enables us to perfrom a lot of important and essential tasks.
