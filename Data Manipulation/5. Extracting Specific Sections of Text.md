# Extracting Specific Sections of Text
The challenge requires you to remove garbage values from our flag which is printed vertically as columns. As such, we need to use our knowledge fromn the previous challenge, accompanied by the knowledge from this one.

## My Solve
**Flag:**  'pwn.college{cOJZrk8f403rNMLm1s7Ri3Frb65.0lNxEzNxwSM0AzNzEzW}'

In this challenge, we use the '/challenge/run' command first to inspoect the contents of the flag to decide exactly what parameters to enter for the next command.
For the next command, after inspection, we use '/challenge/run | cut " " -f 2 | tr -d "\n"

## What I learned
I learned how to extract just one column from a large set of data using the 'cut' command and on how to specify which column we want to cut out and then pipe that data into the 'tr' command to combine the multiple seperate charecters into a single line to make the flag readable.
This also helped me learn to apply multiple concepts together in somewhat more complicated scenarios.
