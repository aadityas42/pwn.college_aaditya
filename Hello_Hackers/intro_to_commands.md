# Intro to Commands
This challenge is to help you execute your first command in a linux environment.

## My Solve
**Flag:** 'pwn.college{0rkTrc45vsLDDc_WTSeraw1t8zA.QX3YjM1wSM0AzNzEzW}'
First, we execute the 'whoami' command which gives us an output 'hacker'. This is a command to know the identity of the user.
Next, we execute the 'hello' command to get out flag.


```
hacker@hello~intro-to-commands:~$ whoami
hacker
hacker@hello~intro-to-commands:~$ hello
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{0rkTrc45vsLDDc_WTSeraw1t8zA.QX3YjM1wSM0AzNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
I learned that the use of whoami is to check the users identity and the hello command to get the flag.

## References
Nil.
